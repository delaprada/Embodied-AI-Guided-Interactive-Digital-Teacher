We propose MAGI, a novel system providing Embodied AI-Guided Interactive digital teachers for education, which integrates LLM-based chatbot technology. To ensure MAGI generates answers without hallucination, we employ a novel
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm to organize and retrieve useful educational documents for the LLM. Moreover, we create animatable 3D avatars powered by text-to-speech and audio-to-motion models to provide students with interactive conversation experiences. We highlight the possibility of MAGI to enhance education accessibility and improve the overall learning experience.
